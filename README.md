# local-template-renderer

A library for pulling in a mustache template from a remote template provider and renders it locally.

It is responsible:
- rendering the mustache template it downloads
- periodically checks to see if an updated template is available

Instructions around installation will come soon as this library is still in Alpha development.

You can add it to your project by adding this to your dependencies.

`"uk.gov.hmrc" %% "local-template-renderer" % "<version>"`
